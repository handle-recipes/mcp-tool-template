## Features

### üõí **Shopping Cart Integration**
- Add recipe ingredients to ODA.no cart
- Add specific ingredients to cart
- View current cart contents
- Search for products on ODA.no

### üîç **Product Search**
- Search ODA.no product catalog
- Get detailed product information

### üìã **Recipe Integration**

## Setup

### 1. Get ODA.no API Access

ODA.no's API requires pre-approval. Contact ODA.no to request API access:

1. **Contact ODA.no**: Reach out to ODA.no with details about your application
2. **Receive Credentials**: You'll get a unique `User-Agent` and `Client-Token`
3. **Keep Credentials Secure**: Store them as environment variables

### 2. Environment Variables

Add these environment variables to your `.env` file:

```bash
# ODA.no API Configuration
ODA_USER_AGENT=YourAppName/1.0
ODA_CLIENT_TOKEN=your-client-token-here
ODA_BASE_URL=https://oda.com/no
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

The integration uses the existing axios instance from the authentication client.

## Error Handling

The integration includes comprehensive error handling:

- **API Errors**: Network and authentication errors are caught and reported
- **Product Not Found**: Ingredients without matching products are clearly marked
- **Invalid Credentials**: Clear error messages for authentication issues

## Limitations

1. **API Access Required**: ODA.no API requires pre-approval
2. **Product Matching**: Ingredient matching relies on search algorithms
3. **Availability**: Product availability may change
4. **Rate Limits**: ODA.no may have rate limits on API calls

## Security

- **Credentials**: Store API credentials securely as environment variables
- **HTTPS**: All API calls use HTTPS
- **Authentication**: Proper authentication headers are included in all requests

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Failed to search products"**
   - Check ODA_USER_AGENT and ODA_CLIENT_TOKEN
   - Verify ODA_BASE_URL is correct
   - Ensure API access is approved

2. **"No matching product found"**
   - Try different search terms
   - Check if product is available on ODA.no
   - Verify ingredient names are correct

3. **"Failed to add items to cart"**
   - Check if user is logged in to ODA.no
   - Verify product IDs are valid
   - Check cart permissions

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting:
```bash
DEBUG=oda-integration
```

## Future Enhancements

- **Cart Management**: Remove items, update quantities
- **Price Comparison**: Compare prices across products
